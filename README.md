# Friction
A short movement-based game, playable [here](https://wjreynard.itch.io/friction).

Find scripts under /Assets/0_scripts.

I built the game on top of a [prototype made by Mew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6AGmOCztP4). The bulk of his work can be found in the following scripts: cl_player, cl_misc, cl_pitch, cl_yaw, StrafeMovement.cs, but in places they do include edits/additions from me.
